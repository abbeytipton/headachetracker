    <h3>When you have a headace, you can come here to log information about it. You will also be asked a series
        of questions about different triggers. After you've logged
        a few headaches, you will see graphs of these triggers showing how often they appeared before a headache.<br><br>
        Before we log your first headache, let's take the time to look at the list of suggested triggers and make
        sure you want to include all of them. You will also be able to add up to 10 of your own triggers.
