# headachetracker

This web app is in progress. It is a tracker for headaches, in which users can log in, add a headache (by answering relevant questions about their activity before and during the headache) and then view graphs showing them their most common triggers.

Left to do:
- Add instructions to the graphs page (just need to style modal popup and add actual text)
- Make link for editing/deleting a log functional
- Make editing/deleting function work in the table of logs
- When creating a log, medicine checkmark isn't showing right
- When finishing a log, the save image isn't showing
- Graphs - finish redoing them with the new plugin and remove old plugin files
- Testing, general organization
- Add instructions based on bool for first time user looks at graphs
