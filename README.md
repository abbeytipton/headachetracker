# headachetracker

This web app is in progress. It is a tracker for headaches, in which users can log in, add a headache (by answering relevant questions about their activity before and during the headache) and then view graphs showing them their most common triggers.

Left to do:
- When creating a log, medicine checkmark isn't showing right
- Testing, general organization
- Mobile optimization
- Fill custom trigger text if the user doesn't

What's in progress?
- Edit triggers/custom triggers page
