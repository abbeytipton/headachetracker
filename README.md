# headachetracker

This web app is in progress. It is a tracker for headaches, in which users can log in, add a headache (by answering relevant questions about their activity before and during the headache) and then view graphs showing them their most common triggers.

Left to do:
- Make editing/deleting function work in the table of logs
- When creating a log, medicine checkmark isn't showing right
- Testing, general organization
- Add instructions based on bool for first time user looks at graphs
- Mobile optimization
- Fill custom trigger text if the user doesn't

What's in progress?
- Adding instructions to the graphs page //
